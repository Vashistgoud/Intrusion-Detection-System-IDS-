### Intrusion Detection System

An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a security solution designed to analyze network traffic and notify administrators or security teams whenever it identifies unusual or unauthorized activities. OpenCV, a widely used open-source library, provides tools and algorithms for tasks like image processing, object detection, and motion tracking, making it an excellent choice for implementing visual intrusion detection systems.

#### Installation

To set up the required libraries, use the `pip` package manager as follows:

pip install opencv-python
pip install cvzone
pip install twilio
